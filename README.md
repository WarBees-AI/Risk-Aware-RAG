# Risk-Aware Introspective RAG (RAI-RAG)
[![Read Article](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Full%20Article-black?logo=medium)](https://medium.com/@miraj.ai/risk-aware-introspective-rag-building-safety-aligned-retrieval-systems-for-trustworthy-ai-6be3738d2a6c)

**RAI-RAG** is a research framework for **safety-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** that treats **retrieval as a safety-critical decision**, rather than a neutral preprocessing step.  
It extends **introspective reasoning, safety-dominant search, and meta-learning** to control *whether to retrieve*, *what evidence to use*, and *how retrieved knowledge influences generation*.

> **Core insight**  
> A language model can be aligned at generation time and still produce *grounded but unsafe outputs* if retrieval supplies unsafe evidence.  
> **RAI-RAG aligns evidence access, not only output.**

## High-Level Architecture

RAI-RAG introduces a **safety-first RAG pipeline** where retrieval becomes an auditable, optimizable decision governed by structured introspection and safety policies. RAI-RAG is a **safety-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that makes *evidence access* an explicit, auditable, and optimizable part of alignment. Unlike standard RAG pipelines that perform retrieval unconditionally, RAI-RAG treats retrieval as a **safety-critical action** that must be justified by **structured introspective reasoning** before any external knowledge is fetched or used. At a high level, RAI-RAG decomposes end-to-end generation into **five stages** with clear interfaces, enabling modular research (swap retrievers/judges/search) while maintaining a consistent safety contract across the entire pipeline.

### 1) User Prompt Ingestion
**Input:** user prompt `x`  
The system first normalizes and logs the raw query (e.g., language detection, basic sanitation, and optional PII stripping depending on policy). At this stage, RAI-RAG does *not* retrieve any documents. The prompt is treated as an untrusted input that may contain role-play framing, forced prefixes, or jailbreak patterns.

**Output:** canonicalized prompt object:
- `x.text`
- `x.metadata` (timestamp, source, optional domain tag)

### 2) Structured Introspection (Risk & Intent Analysis)
RAI-RAG performs **structured introspective reasoning** to infer the user’s intent and assess safety risks *prior to retrieval*. The introspection process produces a step-wise trace (e.g., `<Reasoning_step> ... </Reasoning_step>`) that is strictly separated from the final output (`<Output> ... </Output>`). This separation ensures that:
- safety reasoning is explicit and inspectable,
- unsafe content is not “leaked” into the final response,
- downstream modules can condition behavior on validated reasoning states.

Typical introspective sub-tasks include:
- **Intent inference:** benign information seeking vs. harmful procedural request vs. disguised intent
- **Policy mapping:** which safety category/policy constraints apply
- **Ambiguity assessment:** whether intent is unclear or borderline, requiring conservative handling
- **Retrieval necessity analysis:** is external evidence required to answer safely and helpfully?

**Output:** introspection trace `y_IR` (validated and parsed), plus a structured state:
- `intent_hypothesis`
- `risk_category`
- `confidence` / `uncertainty`
- `retrieval_need` (provisional)

### 3) Risk-Aware Retrieval Decision (Retrieve / Restrict / No-Retrieve)
In standard RAG, retrieval is always executed. In RAI-RAG, retrieval is a **decision** produced by the introspection policy. Concretely, the system chooses one of three actions:

- **Retrieve:** proceed with normal retrieval when risk is low and external evidence is needed.
- **Restrict Retrieval:** retrieve under constraints when risk is moderate or ambiguous, e.g.:
  - domain allowlist (trusted sources only),
  - time windows (avoid outdated or policy-sensitive historical content),
  - reduced `top_k`,
  - query rewriting to remove procedural/harmful intent triggers.
- **No-Retrieve:** skip retrieval entirely when:
  - the request is clearly unsafe (retrieval would amplify harm), or
  - the question can be safely answered from general knowledge without external documents.

This stage is the **central safety innovation**: RAI-RAG recognizes that retrieval can be an attack surface, and therefore must be controlled.

**Output:** retrieval plan `π_rag(x, y_IR)` containing:
- action ∈ {Retrieve, Restrict, No-Retrieve}
- retrieval constraints (if any)
- retrieval query (original or rewritten)
- expected evidence type (definitions, high-level overview, non-procedural references)

### 4) Safe Evidence Selection (Retrieval + Evidence Safety Filtering)
If retrieval is enabled, RAI-RAG retrieves a candidate set of documents `D = {d_i}` using a chosen retriever (FAISS/BM25/hybrid). It then applies **evidence-level safety alignment** to ensure that retrieved documents are safe to use.

This stage includes two complementary operations:

1. **Document Retrieval**
   - run the retrieval query under the selected constraints,
   - optionally rerank using a cross-encoder or lightweight reranker.

2. **Evidence Safety Scoring & Pruning**
   Each document is evaluated with an evidence safety function:
   - `S_e(d_i | x, y_IR)` → safety score (e.g., in `[-1, 1]`)
   - documents with negative score (policy-violating, procedural harm, extremist content, etc.) are filtered out
   - if too many documents are filtered, the system may:
     - fall back to restricted retrieval,
     - trigger query rewriting,
     - or switch to a safe high-level response without external evidence.

This prevents **grounded harm** (unsafe answers supported by retrieved text) and mitigates **retrieval-driven jailbreaks** (prompts designed to fetch harmful documents).

**Output:** safe evidence bundle `D_safe` plus provenance:
- kept docs (IDs, snippets, scores)
- filtered docs (reasons for filtering)
- audit trail for reproducibility

### 5) Introspective Answer Synthesis (Grounded, Safe, and Justified)
Finally, RAI-RAG synthesizes the response conditioned on:
- the validated introspection trace `y_IR`,
- the safe evidence `D_safe` (if available),
- the applicable policy constraints.

The generator can produce one of three outcomes depending on risk and evidence availability:

- **Safe grounded response:** uses only `D_safe`, avoids prohibited procedural details, and provides verifiable claims where possible.
- **High-level safe summary:** when the topic is sensitive or evidence is borderline, respond with non-actionable, general guidance.
- **Refusal (with safe alternatives):** when the user’s intent is clearly unsafe or policy-disallowed.

Optionally, RAI-RAG can apply **test-time selection** (best-of-`N`, beam search) guided by a **process reward model** that scores partial trajectories for safety/helpfulness consistency, selecting the safest high-quality candidate.

**Output:** final response `f` with optional:
- citations or snippet references,
- structured refusal template,
- safety justification (if enabled by setting)
